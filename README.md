AndroidStudio Project.
I'm Igwe Magnus Nnamdi, and this is Android Studio project. 
Over a year since it was first announced, Android Studio 2.0 has finally been released,
and it's now Google's only fully-supported IDE for Android developers. 
I'll start by describing how to install Android Studio and where to find the Android SDK 
and other critical resources after installation. Then I'll take you on a tour of the user 
interface, managing files and folders, and working with menus, toolbars, and tool windows. 
I'll show you how to use keyboard and menu shortcuts for writing and refactoring code, and
how to use the debugging tools with breakpoints, watch variables, and more.
